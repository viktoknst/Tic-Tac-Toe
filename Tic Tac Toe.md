This is a TicTacToe game created in python which has two gamemodes - multiplayer and singleplayer.

Features:
 - The user can play against an AI bot
 - The user can play against a friend
 - The user can chose how big the grid should be
 - The user can sign up, log in and log out of the game

The app uses MongoDB to store all the user information, FastAPI and websocket communication for the multiplayer part and Tkinter as GUI for the visual representation of the grid.
